Korolov Missions
----------------

Rewrite of Korolov Shipping using recent Transcendence features (MissionType,
Language elements etc.) along with various tweaks and new missions.

Includes more complex Charon Raider AI (drake / frigates spawned in Korolov
escort missions). When idle the raider will actively hunt for freighters (based
on EP NAU mission 3 AI). Raider will actually loot from targets and take cargo
to Charon stations. Raider will retreat to a Charon base when damaged and
repair.


TO DO
-----

Communication menu for more ships / escorts

Korolov freighters
* message when under attack / badly damaged etc

Korolov squadron
* Comms menu: status (return latest order?)
* more messages from leader: e.g. cover me

Kronosaurus
* Rewrite using rpg character + separate event handler (cf Failsafe) so we can
  reuse Kronosaurus in multiple missions
